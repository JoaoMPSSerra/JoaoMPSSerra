Organic crystals, particularly rubrene, offer exceptional light-detection capabilities in the visible range. This is of particular relevance for the development of next-generation solar cells, visible light communication and the expanding “internet of things”. Single-crystals grown by physical vapor processes have high performance and can exceed the maximum output of equivalent Silicon-based sensors, but are grown with random geometries. In my research, I developed and implemented a novel protocol to transform arbitrarily shaped crystals into precise, application-specific geometries using various microfabrication techniques, specifically optical lithography and reactive ion etching. Key to this process was the introduction of two different protective layers (spin-coated PVA and PMMA) to shield the crystals from chemicals during processing, as well as introducing a strategy to remove these layers after processing via water immersion. I characterized the performance of the patterned crystals, adapting a pre-existing control software for experiment automation. The patterned devices achieved performance levels comparable to their unpatterned counterparts, with the next step being the introduction of novel geometries for performance enhancement. To this end, I performed simulations of circular crystals as optical resonators. This research culminated in a publication in a high-impact journal. </p>
