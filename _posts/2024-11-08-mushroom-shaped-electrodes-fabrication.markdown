In the context of neuronal activity recording, planar microelectrodes offer long-term recordings in hundreds of sites simultaneously. However, the planar geometry lacks the efficiency of intracellular recording methods. Introducing 3D geometries, such as “mushroom-shaped” electrodes grown via electrodeposition, significantly enhances electrical coupling between neurons and electrodes. I led the full fabrication of mushroom-shaped electrode arrays, employing a variety of microfabrication techniques: magnetron sputtering of conductive materials, chemical vapor deposition of insulating layers, optical lithography for pattern definition, and reactive ion etching for pattern transfer. I had complete autonomy over process development, from defining the process flow and optimizing conditions to operating all planar microfabrication tools. I also took steps to characterize the passivation layer and select its optimal composition. For electrodeposition and validation with neuronal recordings, I had to cooperate with various teams with multidisciplinary expertise. The project resulted in robust electrode arrays capable of neuronal activity recording, as well as a dedicated process flow for consistent, scalable device fabrication. </p>
