Established microfabrication techniques allow precise control over 2D layouts. Expanding these capabilities into the 3D realm, especially at scales beyond a few micrometers, poses challenges that conventional methods cannot fully address. The introduction of additive manufacturing technologies, such as 3D printing, proves that there is interest in this field, but existing solutions require specialized equipment and usually come at the cost of limited resolution and reduced scalability. I tackled this issue using an approach based on strain engineering. By choosing thin film layers with specifically tuned compositions and intrinsic strains (based on an analytical mathematical model), I was able to deliver self-folding structures with precise control over the resulting angle. By harnessing this typically unwanted effect, I managed to successfully fabricate 3D arrays of electrodes for recordings of electrical activity in neuronal cells. Through the method I developed, precise control of the final morphology was possible, from standard 90Â° bends, to custom angles, including fully curved geometries. My fabricated 3D electrode arrays demonstrated performance comparable or better than that of traditional planar electrodes, validated through electrical characterizations and successful in vitro recordings of neuronal activity. </p>
