In the same context of achieving 3D microscale architectures without introducing the need for specialized equipment, I explored grayscale lithography as an alternative to strain actuation. Recognizing the potential of this approach, I introduced and optimized grayscale lithography in my research laboratory to achieve multi-level exposure using standard lithographic tools that did not have native support for this technique. Examined approaches included dividing the mask into multiple sub-masks, each exposed using a specific energy level, and writing a custom Python script to generate masks with sub-resolution features that modulate light intensity through diffraction. Additionally, I optimized the pattern transfer process with reactive ion etching. As shown in the figure below, this resulted in a multi-step structure obtained in a single lithography and etching step. The resulting structures demonstrated electrical connectivity across multiple levels. While the stress actuation method was ultimately selected for my primary application, interest in this technique was retained in the laboratory, and novel projects following this initiative (now in the field of photonics) are still ongoing. </p>
