<p class="text-justify">
The identification of the parathyroid gland is a common challenge during thyroid surgery. Visually, thyroid and parathyroid tissue are very difficult to distinguish, resulting in accidental removal of the parathyroid gland being common during the operation. A potential avenue for tissue identification was recently discovered in the form of fluorescence, as the two types of tissues have different fluorescence spectra. I contributed to a short-term spectroscopic analysis of parathyroid and thyroid samples by ground-state diffuse reflectance and laser induced luminescence which led to the identification of an emission peak (at 711 nm) with significantly stronger intensity in parathyroid tissue. This peak offers a promising marker for intraoperative identification. 
My contributions include data analysis and treatment, as well as writing most of the analysis and discussion of a published paper, which has since been cited by subsequent studies exploring fluorescence-based tissue identification methods.
